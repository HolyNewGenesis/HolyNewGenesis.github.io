      <h3>Info</h3>
      <p>We were founded at the beginning of <i>"The war to end all wars"</i> (<strong>01.01.1915</strong>), but this did not stay true. We were founded to help those scarred by this war, but it didn't stop, so we changed direction. <br><br>We are going to change this world and make them see the truth behind the curtain. This world is rotten, covered by a layer of evil and darkness, that has shrouded our hearts.<br><br>
      Our first and greatest leader, <i><strong>Gernel Dierich</strong></i>, was a truly great man, but was sadly slain during a cold winter day. <strong>Shot</strong>. Even though he was the greatest, his will was carried through the times by several leaders:<br></p>

        <li>Hans Leif</li>
        <li>Dr. Drief Liewen</li>
        <li>George Clauss</li>
        <li>Fendrick Bristol</li>
        <li><i>Dalton McKernick</i></li>
      </ul></center>
      <h4>Dalton McKernick</h4>
      Dalton McKernick is currently the head of this order and a great man. He was born in <strong>1968</strong>, into a prestigious family of the order. He has succeeded well in bringing forth our beliefs and message. He has made a truly remarkable impact, that hasn't gone unnoticed and will surely never be forgotten. <br><br>We humbly bow down to him, his greatness, our leader, <i>McKernick</i>!
