<h2>Who are we?</h2>
      
<p>We are the order of the <i>New Genesis</i> and we strive to reach the equilibrity, that is Gods will. We wish for a better world and nothing more. <br><br>Listen to the messages of God and let them guide your heart to the light. The darkness that has decended upon this earth and crept into our daily lives, shall be vanquished. We will purge those who stand in the way of His will. <i>Purge! Renew! Redeem!</i></p>

<h3>Info</h3>
      
<p>We were founded at the beginning of <i>"The war to end all wars"</i> (<strong>01.01.1915</strong>), but this did not stay true. We were founded to help those scarred by this war, but it didn't stop, so we changed direction. <br><br>We are going to change this world and make them see the truth behind the curtain. This world is rotten, covered by a layer of evil and darkness, that has shrouded our hearts.<br><br>
Our first and greatest leader, <i><strong>Gernel Dierich</strong></i>, was a truly great man, but was sadly slain during a cold winter day. <strong>Shot</strong>. Even though he was the greatest, his will was carried through the times by several leaders:<font size="2px"><br>Hans Leif<br>Drief Liewen<br>George Clauss<br>Fendrick Bristol<br><i>Dalton McKernick</i><br></font></p>      
<h4>Dalton McKernick</h4>
      
<p>Dalton McKernick is currently the head of this order and a great man. He was born in <strong>1968</strong>, into a prestigious family of the order. He has succeeded well in bringing forth our beliefs and message. He has made a truly remarkable impact, that hasn't gone unnoticed and will surely never be forgotten. <br><br>We humbly bow down to him, his greatness, our leader, <i>McKernick</i>!
